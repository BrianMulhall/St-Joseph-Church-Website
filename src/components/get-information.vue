          <h5 class="card-title">The Elijah Cup</h5>
          <p class="card-text">For the Lord, the God of Israel, says, &ldquo;The jar of flour shall not go empty, nor the jug of oil run dry, until the day when the Lord sends His rain upon the earth.&rdquo; <em>1 Kings 17:14.</em> The Elijah Cup is a chalice that will be presented to a family, individual, or couple each Sunday at the conclusion of the 11:00am Mass. That family will take the Elijah Cup home and use it as a focal point while praying daily for an increase in religious vocations. </p>
            <p>The Elijah Cup will be in a carrying case with a prayer journal. Individuals or family members may enter prayers, thoughts, and/or scripture in the journal throughout the week. This becomes one of our parish prayer journals, part of our parish family&rsquo;s spiritual journey.</p>
            <p>Each week, the Elijah Cup will be returned at the 11:00am Mass. The family that has had the Elijah Cup for the past week will bring it forward at the offertory. The Elijah Cup will then be given to another family at the end of the 11:00am Mass. The Elijah Cup is offered to all parishioners: families, couples, and singles.</p>
            <p>The Elijah Cup Coordinators are Ray and Rita O&rsquo;Keefe who may be reached at 706-790-7407. There is a sign-up sheet in the Narthex or you may call the O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s to sign up.</p>

We recognize that, as part of our following Jesus and in gratitude for all God has given to us, we strive to share our time, talent, and treasure with our church. If you have a gift, a talent, or some time to share, please contact the church office, or Janice Mousseau at 706-798-1920. Financial contributions are always encouraged and welcomed as part of our support of the church. Every parishioner is encouraged to use the contribution envelopes that you will receive in the mail. The envelopes are the only way we can properly credit all contributions to their source. 
            The envelopes also let us know that you attend Mass regularly, and are an active part of our parish family.</p>
