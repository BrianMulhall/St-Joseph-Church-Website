    <h1>History of Our Parish</h1>
    <p>
      In 1954, St. Joseph Church was established as a mission of St. Patrick
      Church, now The Church of the Most Holy Trinity. Father Charles Mahoney
      was assigned to formalize the mission and establish the church that would
      minister to the Catholics of South Augusta know at the time as the Fleming
      Heights area. Burns Memorial Methodist Church on Lumpkin Road graciously
      allowed us to celebrate Sunday Mass in their facility and 360 people
      showed up for the first Mass. Before long rapidly increasing attendance
      made it clear that we needed a larger and more permanent church. Thanks to
      the generosity of Mrs. Bessie Sherling and her daughter, Mrs. Joseph Petty
      of Worchester. Massachusetts &ndash; who donated a nine acre tract of land
      on Lumpkin Road Extension &ndash; the people of St. Joseph could now dream
      of a home of our own. On Sunday, November 27, 1955 that dream became a
      reality as ground was broken for our new church. At this time only 200
      families called our parish home, and the support and sacrifice of these
      dedicated families was critical to the growth we would experience in the
      years to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1956, after less than a year of building, Father Mahoney celebrated the
      first Mass in our new church on June 13, 1956. Father Mahoney remained our
      pastor until July 16, 1958 when Father Nicholas Quinlan, who was serving
      at St. Mary on the Hill, was appointed pastor of St. Joseph Church. Our
      facilities were limited to our church building, so Father Quinlan moved
      into a small room in the back of the church. That same year Lourdes Hall
      was built to house our CCD program and other church activities. We were
      beginning to see our parish life expand beyond Sunday Mass as our parish
      ministries grew. Then, in 1960, at the request of the Bishop we built our
      present rectory. Under the gentle guidance of Father Quinlan, St. Joseph
      parish continued to grow both in numbers and in ministry until he retired
      in 1970.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1970, Father Andrew Doris was appointed pastor. It was under his
      leadership that a permanent Parish Council was established. This was an
      important development in our parish since for the first time we had a
      group of parishioners who were responsible for helping the pastor direct
      the parish&rsquo;s plan. In 1972, St. Nicholas Hall was built to allow us
      to host more activities and expand our religious education program as the
      parish continued to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1975, Father Edward Frank was assigned to our pastor and Father Doris
      was assigned to Savannah. Father Frank brought with his liturgical
      management skills, which contributed to the growth and health of our
      parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1985, Father Frank went on sabbatical for further theological studies,
      and as we said goodbye to Father Frank, we welcomed Father Michael J. Ring
      as our new pastor. Father Ring had been serving as associate pastor at St.
      Joseph, so we had already grown to love him. He was instrumental in the
      expansion of our parish facilities to accommodate our growing family.
      &nbsp;In September 1993 we broke ground for our new church, which was
      dedicated in July 1994. Father Ring then faced a three-year battle with
      cancer which took him to the loving arms of Christ in July 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1997, as our parish mourned the loss of our beloved pastor, Father
      Ring, we welcomed Franciscan Father Sam Zebron, OFM Conventual as our new
      pastor. This Franciscan priest lovingly guided and trained us in many
      Vatican II areas, particularly Liturgical Reform and Pastoral Outreach.
      Under his direction our Worship and Spiritual Life Committee was formed,
      the religious education program was expanded to offer educational
      opportunities for parishioners of all ages, the pastoral council was
      restricted, and our parish outreach ministries flourished. During his
      pastorate the Pastoral Council voted to accept the stewardship model of
      parish leadership inviting parishioners to embrace their baptismal
      responsibility to support our parish with their generous gifts of time,
      talent and treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1999, when Father Zebron was transferred to Macon, Father Robert
      Girardeau served as our Administrator until our new pastor, Father John
      Lyons, arrived in December.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Lyons embraced the idea that Stewardship offers parishioners an
      opportunity to more fully live out the Catholic faith and to strengthen
      the parish as a true family of faith. Some of the new programs introduced
      by Father Lyons were soup and bread dinners during Lent, first Friday
      adoration, yearly Mass at the lake, and Children&rsquo;s Liturgy of the
      Word. Father Lyons oversaw the renovation of Lourdes Hall to become the
      church office, renovation of St. Nicholas Hall and installation of a new
      church roof. Father Lyons encouraged both the Hispanic and Korean
      Communities to take part in St. Joseph&rsquo;s parish life making us one
      of the most diverse parishes in the country. In June 2005, Father Rafael
      Estrada was appointed as parochial vicar under Father Lyons ministering to
      the needs of the Hispanic community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Korean community being as integral part of St. Joseph has had the
      privilege of having three different Korean priests minster to their
      spiritual needs. Father Sang Won Lee served from 2003 to 2007. Upon his
      return to Korea Father Cheol Hyun Jung joined our parish and remained
      until 2011 being replaced with Father Hyeong Ryeol (Joseph) Kim as
      parochial vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2009, Father Lyons was assigned to Savannah and Father Estrada was
      assigned to Baxley. Father Thomas Healy became the new pastor along with
      Father Matthew Ericksen becoming parochial vicar. Father Ericksen
      ministered to the needs of the Hispanic people until 2012 when he was
      assigned to Warner Robins. Father Pablo Migone became the next parochial
      vicar serving the Hispanic community both here and at St. Teresa of Avila
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Father Healy&rsquo;s spiritual guidance a great deal of emphasis has
      been placed on improving religious education for our children. He was
      appointed head of the committee for &ldquo;The Year of Faith&rdquo; for
      the Augusta Deanery.<br />
      Father Healy&rsquo;s most ambitious undertaking has been that of building
      a new rectory that has desperately been needed. With work beginning in
      July 2012 the rectory was blessed by Bishop Gregory J. Hartmayer, OFM
      Conv. on April 26, 2013.
